/*
 Exercise 27: Stream complete by Error

 Consider the data in the stream like:
 stream([1,,,3,,,5,,,Error,,,7,,,]);

 No "Completed" event will be fired at last, but an Error signal will be occur inside the stream.
 The stream will close immediately once an Error occurs.

 A spy Mandarin is inside the avenger, he will appear as an Error, catch him!
