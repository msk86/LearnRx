/*
 Exercise 26: Uncompleted Stream

 Consider the data in the stream like:
  stream([1,,,3,,,5,,,7,,,9,,,]);

 No "Completed" event will be fired.
 That means the CPU process will always on to wait for new data forever.
 But the framework will cut off the uncompleted stream after 3 secs.

 Print all hero's name, you can see the process is waiting for a new hero, but no new data will feed into the stream.
